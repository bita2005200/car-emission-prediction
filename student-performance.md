# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis with Machine Learning

This project analyzes students' math exam performance using various machine learning techniques including Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, and Logistic Regression.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Students Performance in Exams on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).

It contains features such as:  
- Gender  
- Lunch type  
- Test preparation course  
- Parental level of education  
- Reading and writing scores  
- Target variable: Math score

## 🔧 Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression** for predicting math scores  
- **Manual Gradient Descent** implementation for regression  
- **Logistic Regression** for binary classification (math score > 70)

## 📊 Visualizations

- Predicted vs Actual Math Scores  
- Residual Plots  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve
